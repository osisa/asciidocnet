= AsciidoctorJ: Java Bindings for Asciidoctor

Asciidoctor is an implementation of the AsciiDoc format in Ruby.
Thanks to the {url-jruby}[JRuby], an implementation of the Ruby runtime in Java, Asciidoctor can also be executed on a JVM.
{url-repo}[AsciidoctorJ] bundles all gems that are required for executing Asciidoctor and wraps it into a Java API so that Asciidoctor can be used in Java like any other Java library.
Additionally, there is a distribution that you can simply download, unzip and execute without worrying about installing the right Ruby runtime, installing gems etc.
