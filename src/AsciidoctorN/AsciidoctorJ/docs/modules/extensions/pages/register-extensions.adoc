= Register Extensions

Now that we have our extensions ready, we only need to register them.
There are 3 ways to do so, and all of them can combined freely to suit your needs.
Two are manual and one automatic.

Also, at any moment, you can clear the configuration using `unregisterAllExtensions()`:

[source,java]
----
Asciidoctor asciidoctor = Asciidoctor.Factory.create();
asciidoctor.unregisterAllExtensions();
----
