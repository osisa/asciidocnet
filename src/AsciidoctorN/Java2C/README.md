Java to C# Converter
====================

Java to C# converter. Uses javaparser with Java 8 
support from https://github.com/before/javaparser, IKVM.NET to 
convert the javaparser .jar into a .NET .dll, and Roslyn for C# AST generation. 

Pull requests and issue submission welcome.

Getting Started
===============

Clone the repo, build, and launch the Gui WPF app. Click the "..." button on
the left side to load a Java file, and then click Convert to convert to
C# on the right side. Please note that conversion may take up to a few
minutes on large files.

Alternatively, launch the command line (Cli) version to process files
from the command line.

The core library is installable via NuGet at https://www.nuget.org/packages/JavaToCSharp/

License for JavaParser
======================
