[[children-aggregation-usage]]
== Children Aggregation Usage

A special single bucket aggregation that enables aggregating from buckets on parent document types to
buckets on child documents.

Be sure to read the Elasticsearch documentation on {ref_current}/search-aggregations-bucket-children-aggregation.html[Children Aggregation]

=== Fluent DSL Example

[source,csharp]
----
s => s
.Aggregations(aggs => aggs
    .Children<CommitActivity>("name_of_child_agg", child => child
        .Aggregations(childAggs => childAggs
            .Average("average_per_child", avg => avg.Field(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
            .Max("max_per_child", avg => avg.Field(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
        )
    )
)
----

=== Object Initializer Syntax Example

[source,csharp]
----
new SearchRequest<Project>
{
    Aggregations = new ChildrenAggregation("name_of_child_agg", typeof(CommitActivity))
    {
        Aggregations =
            new AverageAggregation("average_per_child", "confidenceFactor") &&
            new MaxAggregation("max_per_child", "confidenceFactor")
    }
}
